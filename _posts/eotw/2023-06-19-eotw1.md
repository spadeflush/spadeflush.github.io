Any [serious player](https://i.imgur.com/BJsEg3r.png) of the grand strategy game Europa Universalis IV would have encountered the following event at least once:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="../../../assets/img/comet.jpeg" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
</div>
<br>
And unless you're lucky enough to have a Scholar as your ruler (in which case praise RNGesus), you're bound to take a stab hit whichever option you choose. However, our focus today isn't the labyrinthic mechanics of EU4—instead we'll take a look at the second option 'The end is nigh!', or, more specifically, the word **nigh**.

*Nigh* started its life as the Old English *nēah*,  meaning 'close by'. It reached its zenith in the Elizabethan era, being often found in biblical texts and Shakespearean literature—as in 'Come our lovely lady nigh' (A Midsummer Night's Dream, Act 2, Scene 2). Beginning the 1600s, however, *nigh* slowly fell out of favour, and nowadays the word finds almost no use outside select roleplay communities. 

So, how did this come to be? To understand, we return to *nigh*'s Old English form *nēah*. It appears that the word had two cousins, the comparative *nēar* and the superlative *nīehst*. You probably see where this is going—*nēar* evolved into the familiar ***near***<d-footnote>Due to phonological changes, by Middle English people no longer felt 'near' was the comparative of 'nigh', instead viewing each as its own, separate word. 'Near' even went on to develop its own comparative and superlative, 'nearer' and 'nearest', which we still use in the modern day.</d-footnote>. What you might not realise, though, is that *nīehst* also evolved into a very common word—if an event is the nearest, then surely it has to be the ***next*** one.

If you speak German, all of this has probably been painfully obvious to you—*nah*, *näher*, (am) *nächsten*. While the connection between these words is far less obvious in English, *nigh* does survive in one modern word—your nearby friends you know as your *neighbours*.
