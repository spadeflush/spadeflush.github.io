Hey! Thanks for stopping by.

I'm a Year 1 Natural Sciences student at the University of Cambridge. I'm broadly interested in neuroscience, though I do have a maths background and can just about code.

In my free time I'm also a photographer, calligrapher and classicist. If I have the time you might also find me joining (socio)linguistics projects.

Please feel free to find me for a chat anytime!
