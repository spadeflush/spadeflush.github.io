# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).

# toc:
#   - name: Equations
#     # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
#     # subsections:
#     #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
#     #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
#   - name: Citations
#   - name: Footnotes
#   - name: Code Blocks
#   - name: Layouts
#   - name: Other Typography?

# # Below is an example of injecting additional post-specific styles.
# # If you use this post as a template, delete this _styles block.
# _styles: >
#   .fake-img {
#     background: #bbb;
#     border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
#     box-shadow: 0 0px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
#     margin-bottom: 12px;
#   }
#   .fake-img p {
#     font-family: monospace;
#     color: white;
#     text-align: left;
#     margin: 12px 0;
#     text-align: center;
#     font-size: 16px;
#   }

<!---**NOTE:**
Citations, footnotes, and code blocks do not display correctly in the dark mode since distill does not support the dark mode by default.
