## Distribution

I have reviewed all the [available past problems](https://www.hkage.org.hk/en/competitions/detail/6896) and assigned each into one of eleven categories. I have further assorted each category into one of four groups, as delineated by colour in the pie chart below. However, do note that **every biological discipline is closely intertwined**, and questions often test the candidate's knowledge on multiple fields.

## General

This is both the easiest *and* hardest category to master. Easy, because no prior knowledge is needed to answer these questions; hard, because you must critically think and have 'common sense'. Questions in this category can be further divided into three subcategories:

<ol>
    <li><strong>Graph-reading.</strong> One of the most common question types in IBOHKC is the interpretation of graphs. <d-footnote>In recent years, some problem-setters have even inserted two pages of diagrams just to ask one question on them. Unless you are experienced in graph-reading, it is recommended that you skip these abnormally long graph questions.</d-footnote> While the data overload may at first seem daunting, the key to cracking these questions is to read the options first. Simply read each option, return to the corresponding graph and verify whether it is correct.<d-footnote>Some questions do require subjective judgment, e.g. 'good' or 'great difference'. In this case, check if there are any asterisks (*) in the graph; the more asterisks, the more significant the difference. Otherwise, trust your instincts.</d-footnote> Be confident when confronted with these questions: you will only need to spend a bit more time, unless you freak out.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Biological sense.</strong> Many explanations of biological phenomena are valid. Few are sound. It is your task to determine whether each statement is true, likely <em>and</em> important.<d-footnote>Credits to the English Debating Team for this point.</d-footnote> Through frequent exposure to biological texts, you will eventually develop this sense; however, even the most seasoned competitors often struggle with judgment. In any case, do NOT overthink.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Common sense.</strong> Many biological phenomena pervade daily life. For example, while your local barber may not know what is CRISPR-Cas9, they certainly know inserting a tomato gene into a fish does not make it a tomato-fish hybrid. It may be easier to crack a question when you know the context behind. Again, do NOT overthink and trust your instincts.
